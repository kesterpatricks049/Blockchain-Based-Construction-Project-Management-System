# Blockchain-Based Construction Project Management

A decentralized solution for transparent, efficient, and accountable management of construction projects through smart contracts and immutable records.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to streamline construction project management, reducing disputes, enhancing quality control, automating payments, and creating a permanent, tamper-proof record of the entire construction lifecycle. By digitizing crucial processes on a distributed ledger, we enable unprecedented transparency and efficiency for all stakeholders.

## Core Components

### Project Specification Contract

Establishes the digital foundation for construction requirements:
- Comprehensive building specifications and standards
- Architectural and engineering designs (stored as IPFS hashes)
- Building code compliance requirements
- Project timelines and deadlines
- Budget allocations and cost estimates
- Change order management protocols
- Dispute resolution mechanisms

### Material Verification Contract

Ensures quality and traceability throughout the supply chain:
- Material origin verification and chain of custody
- Quality certifications and testing results
- Sustainability and compliance documentation
- Inventory management and delivery confirmation
- Defect reporting and remediation tracking
- Integration with IoT sensors for environmental monitoring
- Warranty information storage

### Milestone Completion Contract

Tracks progress and automates payment releases:
- Milestone definitions and acceptance criteria
- Work completion verification workflows
- Progress documentation and photographic evidence
- Automated payment triggers upon milestone approval
- Delay management and timeline adjustments
- Subcontractor task tracking and payment distribution
- Performance metrics and analytics

### Inspection Certification Contract

Manages regulatory compliance and quality assurance:
- Building inspector verification and digital signatures
- Code compliance checklists and documentation
- Permit application and approval tracking
- Safety inspection records
